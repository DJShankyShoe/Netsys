# Network Traffic Analysis Tool

## Overview
The Network Traffic Analysis Tool is a comprehensive solution for monitoring and analyzing network traffic. It provides functionalities for latency testing, network enumeration, and real-time traffic visualization, making it essential for network administrators and security professionals. The tool helps diagnose latency issues, assess network performance, and identify potential security threats.

## Features
- **Latency Measurement Tool**: Accurately measures latency using TCP and ICMP protocols, visualizing patterns for enhanced network performance analysis.
- **Traffic Analysis Dashboard**: Monitors and tracks network traffic metrics for real-time performance evaluation and troubleshooting.
- **Port Scanning Utility**: Identifies open ports on network devices, providing insights for security assessments and vulnerability management.
- **Device Discovery Scanner**: Efficiently detects and catalogs devices on the local network, gathering essential details such as IP and MAC addresses.
- **Network Threat Detection**: Monitors incoming traffic to identify potential network enumeration attempts and suspicious scanning patterns.
- **Customizable Notifications**: Sends email alerts for suspicious activities and unauthorized devices.

## Installation
